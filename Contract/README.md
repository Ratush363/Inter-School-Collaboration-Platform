## Vision

The Inter-School Collaboration Platform is designed to foster seamless collaboration between educational institutions through the use of blockchain technology. This platform leverages smart contracts to allow schools to propose, vote on, and execute collaborative projects. Additionally, schools can share resources like research papers, study materials, and other educational content in a decentralized manner, ensuring transparency, security, and equal participation.

## Smart Contract Overview

The smart contract is written in Solidity and is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides the following functionalities:

1. **Propose Collaboration**: Registered schools can propose new collaborative projects.
2. **Vote on Proposal**: Schools can vote for or against a proposed collaboration.
3. **Execute Proposal**: If a proposal receives more votes in favor than against, it can be executed.
4. **Share Resource**: Schools can share educational resources with the community.
5. **Get Resource**: Anyone can retrieve details about shared resources.

### Contract Address

The smart contract is deployed at the following address on the Ethereum blockchain:

**Contract Address:** 0xfe2c9ae03fc41ba040b263da3932efb8fae417c7

## Future Scope

1. **Decentralized Governance**: Introduce voting power based on a school's reputation or contributions to the platform.
2. **Resource Categorization**: Implement tagging and categorization for shared resources to enhance searchability.
3. **Collaboration Metrics**: Develop analytics to measure the impact and success of collaborative projects.
4. **Cross-Network Compatibility**: Extend the platform's functionality to other blockchain networks for broader adoption.
