Inter-School Collaboration Platform

This project is a basic Solidity smart contract designed to facilitate collaboration between educational institutions. The contract enables schools to propose joint projects, vote on proposals, share resources, and manage collaborations in a decentralized, transparent manner.

Features
1. Collaboration Proposal System
Propose a Collaboration: Schools can propose collaborative projects by submitting a description of the initiative.
Vote on Proposals: Participating schools can vote on each proposal, choosing to support or reject it.
Execute Proposals: Once voting is complete, proposals with more votes in favor than against can be executed.
2. Resource Sharing
Share Resources: Schools can share educational resources such as e-books, research papers, or course materials by registering them on the platform.
Access Shared Resources: Authorized users can view and access details of the shared resources.
3. Access Control
Registered Schools Only: Only institutions that have been registered on the platform can propose, vote, or share resources. This ensures that only legitimate educational institutions can participate.

Contract Details
1. Proposal Struct
id (uint256): Unique identifier for each proposal.
proposer (address): Address of the school that proposed the collaboration.
description (string): Description of the proposed collaboration.
votesFor (uint256): Number of votes in favor of the proposal.
votesAgainst (uint256): Number of votes against the proposal.
executed (bool): Status indicating whether the proposal has been executed.
2. Resource Struct
name (string): Name of the shared resource.
resourceURI (string): URI link to the resource, where it can be accessed or downloaded.
owner (address): Address of the school that shared the resource.
3. Functions
proposeCollaboration(string memory _description)
Allows a registered school to propose a new collaboration.
Stores the proposal details on the blockchain.
voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)
Enables schools to vote on a proposal by providing the proposal ID and a boolean indicating support (true) or rejection (false).
Each school can vote only once per proposal.
executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)
Executes a proposal if it has more votes in favor than against.
Marks the proposal as executed to prevent re-execution.
shareResource(string memory _name, string memory _resourceURI)
Allows a school to share a resource by providing its name and a URI link.
getResource(uint256 _resourceId)
Retrieves details of a specific resource by its ID, including the name, URI, and owner address.
4. Modifiers
onlySchool
Restricts access to certain functions so that only registered schools can execute them.

Example Usage
Deploying the Contract
Deploy the Contract: Deploy the smart contract on a compatible Ethereum network using Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.
Register Schools: In this example, two schools are pre-registered, but you can modify the constructor to add more.
Proposing a Collaboration
Call proposeCollaboration with a description of the proposed project.
The proposal will be added to the list of active proposals.
Voting on a Proposal
Call voteOnProposal with the proposal ID and your vote (true for support, false for against).
The vote will be recorded, and the proposal will be updated with the new vote count.
Executing a Proposal
Once voting is complete, call executeProposal with the proposal ID.
If the proposal has more votes in favor, it will be executed, and marked as such.
Sharing a Resource
Call shareResource with the resource name and a URI link.
The resource will be added to the list of shared resources.
Retrieving a Resource
Call getResource with the resource ID to view the resource details.

Future Enhancements
This contract is a basic model intended to demonstrate the foundational features of an Inter-School Collaboration Platform. Potential enhancements could include:
Decentralized governance using DAOs.
Milestone-based funding mechanisms.
Conflict resolution and arbitration via smart contracts.
Expansion of the resource sharing system to include access control via NFTs.
